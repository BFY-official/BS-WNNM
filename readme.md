Functions for Matlab for the denoising of a SAR image corrupted
by multiplicative speckle noise with the technique described in 
 "A Blind SAR Image Despeckling Method Based on Improved Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization,"
 in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 19, pp. 1-5, 2022, Art no. 4515305, 
doi: 10.1109/LGRS.2022.3217033. written by F. Bo, W. Lu, G. Wang, M. Zhou, Q. Wang and J. Fang,
Please refer to this paper for a more detailed description of the algorithm.

For help on how to use this script, you can e.g. use "demo.m".
Get better results by debugging different parameters in "ParSet.m".
